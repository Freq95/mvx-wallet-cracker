### 📄 `README.md`

```md
# 🛡️ MVX-wallet-cracker
is an educational React app that simulates a blockchain wallet (MultiversX-style),
protected by on-chain mechanisms.

Its goal is to let users **attempt to crack** the wallet by entering
a seed phrase — in a fully safe and educational environment.


## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- ⚛️ React (`create-react-app`)
- 🎨 Tailwind CSS (dark minimal theme)
- 🔃 GitHub Pages for deployment
- 🔐 Fake seed phrase simulation + attempt counter
- 📦 npm + gh-pages for deploy scripts


## 🚀 Live Demo

Hosted on GitHub Pages:
```
🔗 [https://freq95.github.io/mvx-wallet-cracker/](https://freq95.github.io/mvx-wallet-cracker/)



````
## 🧠 Features

- Displays a fake 24-word seed phrase
- Users can input guesses to “crack” the wallet
- Tracks the number of attempts (locally)
- Footer showing version (`v0.1.0.2025`)
- Educational-only use — no real keys or funds

## 🧪 Run Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/wallet-sim-app.git
cd wallet-sim-app
npm install
npm start
````

Then visit:
👉 `http://localhost:3000`
